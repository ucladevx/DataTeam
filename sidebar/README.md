#How to run this Chrome extension

1. Pull the latest version
2. Go into the /sidebar folder
3. Run the command `npm run build`. A new folder named "build" should be created in the /sidebar folder as a result
4. Go into chrome's extension page, and on the top right of the page, toggle "Developer Mode"
5. Go to the top left of the page, and click "Load Unpacked"
6. Select the /sidebar/build folder
7. Now you can go to the calendar.google.com page and hit the Twain icon to toggle the sidebar :-)


    Whenever there are changes, run the command `run npm build` again, and just click the refresh button to update
